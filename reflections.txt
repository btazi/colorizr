How does your gem take advantage of Rubyâ€™s metaprogramming capabilities?
The gem uses 'define_method' method for each color in the String class.
How long did you spend working on this project?
Not too long, I got stuck for a moment because I forgot I was editing the String class but it wasn't very hard.
What was the most rewarding challenge you conquered?
The only problem I had was to build the gem everytime I made a change and install it again, I'm wondering if there isn't an other way to code gems.
Where do you still have room to grow?
I'd love to contribute one day to the rails gem !
